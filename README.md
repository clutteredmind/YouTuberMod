# YouTuberMod

My daughter and I love Minecraft. She's long wanted to have a mod of her own that contains all of her favorite things like her favorite YouTubers and her Minecraft friends. Since I am a software engineer by trade, I thought this might be a project with which I could finally help her.

So I'm in the process of creating this mod when I have spare time. I'm learning lots from watching YouTube tutorials and from reading modder forums. I've been trying to impose order on the project by organizing code in a way that seems to make sense to me and by naming things consistently. I'm not a Java programmer though, so maybe there's some stuff in there that doesn't make sense. I'm happy to be corrected or whatever.

I want to give credit for the Turtle mob to Kevin M on YouTube. He made a pretty good series of videos that I followed that starts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUZ7hml59p8

There are other YouTubers that I should probably thank, but it's been a couple weeks and my memory is bad, so I'll add them if I remember who they were.

A couple of screenshots of the work in progress:

The Steve-skinned model is StripeTheDog. I haven't found a good skin for him yet.
